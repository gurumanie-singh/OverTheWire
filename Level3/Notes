Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Notes:
Logging into the next level. When we do ls, we see the directory "inhere".
We then cd into this directory.

When we ls, we notice there is no files.
Then we do:
  ls -la

Alternatively, we can also do:
  ls -a  

This shows us all the files. 
It also shows this file called:
...Hiding-From-You

This is the file we want to access.

Then we do:
cat ...Hiding-From-You

And we get the next password.
