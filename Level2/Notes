Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called "spaces in this filename" located in the home directory

Notes:
After using password found in the "-" file from last level.
We now log in to bandit2.

In this bandit2 directory, when we do ls, there is only one file called "spaces in this filename".

If we try to do:
  cat spaces in this filename

Then the following is returned:
  cat: spaces: No such file or directory
  cat: in: No such file or directory
  cat: this: No such file or directory
  cat: filename: No such file or directory

Instead, we need to do:
  cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Alternatively, we can also do:
  cat "spaces in this filename" 

This gives us the password.
