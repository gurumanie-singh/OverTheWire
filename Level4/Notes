Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

Notes:
In order to find the password for next level, we need to look into a directory called "inhere".

This directory contains file00 to file09 but they all start with "-file00"
Meaning that we cannot just do:
  cat -file00

We need to do:
  cat ./-file00

This lets us read into the file. But this is not efficient since there are so many files. It is tedious to cat into each one.

This is when we use the command below:
  file ./-*

The above command combines the approach we need to use to see into files that start with a "-".
But since we included the "*" and we are using file instead of cat, it gives us the file type for all files that start with "-".

Below is the output:
  ./-file00: PGP Secret Sub-key -
  ./-file01: data
  ./-file02: data
  ./-file03: data
  ./-file04: data
  ./-file05: data
  ./-file06: data
  ./-file07: ASCII text
  ./-file08: data
  ./-file09: data

With the above, we can tell that the human readable file is file07. So finally we do:
  cat ./-file07

And now we have the password for the next level.
