Level Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

Notes:
From level 0 to 1. We got the password in the readme file. 
To use that password and jump to new level, we exit the ssh, then re-enter login as bandit1 (for level 1), and new password given in readme.
Then once logged into new level, we cd into bandit1 directory.
Now when we ls, there is a - file.
When we try to cat - , it does not work and we get sent back to home.
‘-’ is a special symbol in Linux. So it is not recommended to start a file name with this symbol.

Because of this, we need another way to access the file.
So instead of writing just - we add the path and write ./- and the command works as it should.
Now we have the password to the next level.
