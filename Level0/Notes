Level Goal:
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. 
The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. 
The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

Notes:
First use man SSH command in terminal to find out how to specify port and user. (man command is for manual)
Port can be specified using -p (port)
Username can be specified using -l (login name)

Then, using ls we can see the files inside.

We see only one file called "readme"

To open it or read it we do cat readme. 
Then we are able to see the password for level 1.
